How it works:
  * Goal is to reach the exit
  * Guards will guard the level
  * Guards have a visible field of view
  * Guards vill move in real time
  * If a guard detects you you will be brought back to the start of the level
  * You have a certain amount of stepps/energy available
  * Gain stepps/Energy from a pickup. Like a protein bar for example
  * You can only hold a maximum amount of stepps at one time. Maybe increase every 2 levels?
  * There will be other pickups to help you dispose/slowdown/confuse/gain attention of guards
  * If you run out of stepps its over
