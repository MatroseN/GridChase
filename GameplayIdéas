How it works:
  * Goal is to reach the exit
  * Guards will guard the level
  * Guards have a visible field of view (Their flashlight)
  * Guards vill move in real time
  * There is a timer
  * When timer ends the light turns on and the guards can see you (if there is a clear view)
  * When a guard sees you he will chase you down.
  * If a guar catches you you will be brought back to the start of the level
  * There will be other pickups to help you dispose/slowdown/confuse/gain attention of guards
  * If you run out of stepps its over
